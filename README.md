Goal: Match 8-bit RGB colors from Fruit Jam DVI output with 24-bit sRGB or P3
colors on a computer.

**CAUTION:** This code was developed and tested on a pre-release revision B
Fruit Jam prototype board using CircuitPython 10.0.0-alpha builds from the
circuitpython.org
[Fruit Jam downloads](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_fruit_jam/) page.
Things may change by the time CircuitPython 10.0.0 is released.
